Proxy to the dependency solvers at the IRILL solver farms

This small shell-script will setup a placeholder for "aspcud", giving the power
of the external solver to OPAM by sending queries to the solver farms at
http://cudf-services.irill.org

This can easily be bypassed when needed with command-line option
--use-internal-solver or by setting the variable OPAMUSEINTERNALSOLVER
